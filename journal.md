So although social media or technology in general is beneficial towards the election, it can still have plenty of negatives.

Technology and AI are constantly advancing as time moves on.  What excites me is its potential to solve complex problems, improve lives, and create new possibilities.  An innovative way technology could be used in my field of interest is to develop a mobile app that allows citizens to easily identify and report invasive plant species in their local areas.  Some ethical considerations that need to be addressed are,  guide regulation, oversight, protection of privacy and confidentiality.  Although the advancements of technology have many benefits, it is still very important that we regulate it safely.
